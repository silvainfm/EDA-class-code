## Healthcare Outcomes, Perceptions, & Political Ideology

The data set `health` has several variables capturing the health
outcomes and politics of U.S. states, such as the infant mortality rate
and percent of the population that have a favorable attitude toward the
Affordable Care Act.

## Data dictionary

To read brief descriptions about the individual variables, see the data
dictionary markdown file on github.

## Your task: explore the data

-   Be clear.
-   Use R programming only (no python or excel).
-   At a minimum aim for two well developed, original different data
    visualizations (use two different graphical presentations of the
    data). Avoid making a map.
-   Interpret your findings.
-   You are *not* allowed to work with other students but you *can* ask
    me questions.
-   Do not cheat and find examples of these data used online. Firstly,
    that should be rather difficult and will waste your time. Secondly,
    be original!
-   You *must* push your work in an .rmd file to github in your
    *assignments* repo
-   You *must* also knit to MD flavored github doc and push this to
    github too.
-   You can edit this document however you want or make your own RMD to
    use.

## Points

Do not fret! This is not a big percentage of your grade.

-   This is worth 10 points (equivalent of 1 hw) which go into the
    “participation, quizzes, and assignments” category of your
    gradebook.
-   5 points = demonstrated effort but incomplete submission
-   6-8 points = good work, meets expectations, but with some room for
    improvement.
-   10 points = terrific job, exceeds expectations, little room for
    improvement.

There are also prizes.
